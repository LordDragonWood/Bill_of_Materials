This program was created for Pason. The company provides monitoring equipment for tracking the drilling of oil wells.

The program is designed to ensure that when any of the systems that Pason offered was ordered for an oil rig it also added all required peripherals to the list. This addition required verification by the technician placing the order since the required equipment may have already been on hand.

As with all my Excel based programs, I included custom Ribbon controls for using the macros. And enabling macros is required to use the program since the main functionality is handled by these.

Also included is a user's manual explaining how to use this program. As well as two additional files that are also required. One is a form you send to the customer to find out what they need for their rig. Once completed, this form can be imported into the program. The second file is the same form, but completed with a non-exiting rig's information for testing purposes.

As with all programs I develop I built it to fulfill a specific purpose, but left it able to be expanded and/or used for other things. In this case, it was created primarily for the international division and off-shore oil rigs since sending equipment to these is expensive and not having required items is not an option. However, it can be used by the land based (within the United States) rigs as well.

Modifying this program for a different company would be near impossible. However, using it and the macros included as a guide for creating a similar program for a different company is well within the rhelm of possible.

Please feel free to look it over and let me know if I missed anything, could improve on something, or just have comments or questions about it.

I put this here as part of my portfolio and have no plans to make any changes to it. But I still would like to learn of things I could do better.
